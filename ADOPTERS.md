Module Adopters
===============

When you adopt a module, you are making sure that the investment of the original authors is not lost.  You may also learn a thing or two from adopting and maintaing code that has been made by other people.  So please consider adopting one or more modules from the [Module Adoption Center](ADOPT-ME.md): you'll be doing the community *and* yourself a favour!

The following modules have been adopted from raku-community-modules (in chronological order):
