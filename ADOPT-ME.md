Raku Module Adoption Center
===========================

These modules are part of the Raku ecosystem, but currently do not have an active maintainer.  You are invited to take ownership of these modules for whatever reason, provided that any module changes will not break the ecosystem, or the code of users that use such a module.

Taking over ownership is as easy as forking the module, making changes to it and make it known to the maintainers of the ecosystem that your version should now be considered to be the authoritative version of the module.

These are the modules currently awaiting your support:
- foo bar
- bar baz

Thank you for your attention.
