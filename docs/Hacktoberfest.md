# Hactkoberfest Squashaton

The PerlÂ 6 community celebrates a [monthly bug squash (long)
day](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day),
and we make the one in Octobre coincide
with [the Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

We want all the community to benefit from this, so we have created a
procedure that makes (relatively) easy to participate in the
Squashathon, at the same time your pull-requesters participate in
Hacktoberfest. The main objective of this is to be aware of the
modules people have offered, so that the bots take care of them and
publish modifications in the Perl 6 IRC channels.
